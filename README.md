# Search and Amphibious Vehicle for Immediate Operational Rescue
### In the last 10 years, over 2 million people have been injured in natural disasters worldwide. With the rapid global onset of climate change, the world is becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. The aftermath of such disasters creates treacherous terrains, making search and rescue operations challenging. Our solution is SAVIOR: a remote-operated, amphibious vehicle equipped with a GPS, camera, and medical supplies. SAVIOR will travel through damaged terrains after natural disasters in search of victims who need medical help, and provide them with immediate aid. This cost-effective, versatile solution can be implemented on a mass scale to save lives. Unlike human-led rescue operations, SAVIOR can be deployed immediately following a disaster without endangering human lives, allowing it to aid victims in a shorter time frame.
